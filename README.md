Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of data science projects that I've worked on, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field.

## Project Descriptions

1. **Project 1: Medical Insurance Cost**
   
  - **Description:**

The Medical Cost Personal Datasets is a public dataset used in the book "Machine Learning with R" by Brett Lantz. The dataset has been cleaned and recoded to match the format in the book. It contains information about medical insurance charges for individuals based on various factors. The original dataset is available on Kaggle Medical Cost Personal Datasets.

  - **Objective of the Analysis:**
  
The objective of this analysis is to predict medical insurance charges for individuals using the provided dataset. By exploring the relationships between variables such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, residential region, and medical costs, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate insurance charges. This analysis will employ various regression algorithms and evaluate their performance to identify the most effective model for predicting insurance costs.
By accomplishing this objective, we can gain insights into the factors that significantly impact medical insurance charges and potentially contribute to more accurate cost estimations in the insurance industry.

Inspiration: The main inspiration behind this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately predict insurance costs. By exploring the relationships between various factors and individual medical charges, we aim to build a model that can provide valuable predictions for insurance companies and individuals alike. The outcomes of this analysis can have practical applications in cost estimation, risk assessment, and informed decision-making in the insurance domain.

Throughout this project, we will follow a structured approach, including data exploration and preprocessing, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, as well as implementing and evaluating multiple regression algorithms. The goal is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates medical insurance charges based on the available dataset.

2. **Project 2: Predicting Customer Churn in an Iranian Telecom Company**
   
  - **Description:**

In the telecommunications industry, customer churn, or the rate at which customers leave a service, is a crucial metric that impacts the company's revenue and growth. Understanding the factors that lead to customer churn and predicting potential churners can help the company take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

  - **Objective of the Analysis:**

The main objective of this analysis is to build a predictive model using logistic regression to identify customers who are likely to churn based on historical data. By predicting potential churners, the telecom company can implement targeted retention strategies, offer personalized promotions, or address customer concerns, ultimately reducing churn rates and enhancing customer loyalty.

3. **Project 3: Dolphin Social Network Analysis and Visualization**
   
  - **Description:**

In the realm of ecological studies, understanding the intricate relationships within animal communities is paramount. One captivating example of such interactions is the dolphin social network. Dolphins, as highly social creatures, exhibit patterns of association that can shed light on their social structures and behaviors.

  - **Objective of the Analysis:**

The primary objective of this analysis is to delve into the social network dynamics of a community of 62 dolphins residing off Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. By exploring their frequent associations, we aim to uncover insights into the connectivity, relationships, and potential communities within this dolphin population.

  - **Research question:**

"How do dolphins form associations and interact within their community, and what insights can these interactions provide about their social dynamics?"
