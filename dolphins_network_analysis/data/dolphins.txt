Community Detection:

Apply community detection algorithms such as Louvain or CDLIB to identify communities within the dolphin social network.
Visualize detected communities using a networkmap or hiveplot.

Centrality Measures:

Calculate various centrality measures such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
Compare and visualize these centrality measures using scatter plots, violin plots, or bubble charts.

Assortativity and Correlation:

Calculate assortativity coefficient to understand the preference for associations between dolphins of similar centrality.
Visualize correlations between centrality measures using correlation matrix plots.

Network Visualization Enhancement:

Utilize directed graph layouts to showcase the nature of associations between dolphins.
Experiment with interactive layouts that consider node sizes to represent centrality measures.

Power Law Distribution and Fitting:

Analyze the degree distribution of the dolphin social network to assess if it follows a power law distribution.

Community Composition and Social Roles:
You can calculate the degree centrality of each dolphin within their respective community and identify the dolphins with the highest degree centrality. These highly central dolphins could be considered as potential "connectors" within the network, bridging different communities.

Social Roles and Influence:
You can calculate various centrality measures, such as betweenness centrality or eigenvector centrality, to identify dolphins that play important roles within their community or the overall network. Visualize these measures to highlight influential dolphins or communities.
